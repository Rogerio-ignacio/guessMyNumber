My first JS project, the game consists of typing in a number (1 - 20) and trying to match the number hidden behind the question mark (?). With each mistake your points (20) are subtracted by 1. When you hit the number behind the ? the game ends and you win, if you miss until your twenty points are up, you lose the game. Note: Your highest score is saved as a highscore.
